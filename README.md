# argon-assault

A rail shooter game.

It's a unity project.

## Disclaimer about the assets

Some of the assets are imported. I tried to ignore them to not to share them publicly without proper permission of the owner.
However, if I have done some mistakes (afterall this is a toy project) please beware that some of the assets might be some other
person's intellectual property and might not be suitable for redistribution, commercial use and all sorts of other license stuff.

If you plan to fork this repository, please make sure you replace ALL asssets except the scripts (I'm sure they are mine :) ) with the
assets you'd get from Unity for free or pay for it.

I can easily say that none of the assets that might leak into this repository will be paid and improperly redistributed. It'll be free anyways.

But you are warned.

## Future Developments

## Some advertisement

This repo is not sponsorred or something. I just want to give my appreciations.

Afterall this is a toy project that is doomed to be abandoned. But I have initiated this with the  [Udemy Course](https://udemy.com/course/unitycourse2) that
I was following. Cool course. Totally suggest it (no affiliation at all). Also [Udemy](https://udemy.com) is a cool website. Please check it out.
