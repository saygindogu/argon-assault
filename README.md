## Some advertisement

This repo is not sponsorred or something. I just want to give my appreciations.

Afterall this is a toy project that is doomed to be abandoned. But I have initiated this with the  [Udemy Course](https://udemy.com/course/unitycourse2) that
I was following. Cool course. Totally suggest it (no affiliation at all). Also [Udemy](https://udemy.com) is a cool website. Please check it out.
